        <h2 class="about-header">Welcome to my site!</h2>
        <p>I am a rising senior at the University of Notre Dame majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am enthusiastic, hard-working, ambitious, and relish in the opportunity to prove myself. My passion to apply hands-on skills and knowledge to create better products has brought me to the point where I am today. My dream is to engage with an elite technology company to design and innovate products that can revolutionize and enhance lives around me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With previous and current experience as an engineering intern, I am looking for opportunities to design, test, and validate products. My professional experience in project management coupled with technical expertise I have gained through the classroom, research, clubs, and projects has provided me with the skills needed to solve advanced engineering problems and will make me a valuable contributor to your team. Furthermore, with quick mastery of concepts and a passion to learn, I will pick up additional skills in no time. Please take a look at my profile, and reach out to learn more!</p>
