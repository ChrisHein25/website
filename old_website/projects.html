          <h3 class="project-header">Notre Dame Rocket Team - Mechanical Recovery System</h3>
            <p>Assisted with the design and build of a fully mechanical release/parachute recovery mechanism for NASA's annual Student Launch Competition as part of membership with Notre Dame Rocketry Team. Responsible for CAD design, stress/strain analysis, concept generation, design analysis, design reports, safety training, weekly team and squad meetings. Additionally, I composed written sections for the Preliminary Design Review and Critical Design Review, which were reviewed by NASA personnel.

          <h3 class="project-header">Notre Dame Rocket Team - Autonomous Rover</h3>
          <p>Assisted with the design, creation, and implementation of a fully-deployable rover system for the Notre Dame Rocketry Team as part of the annual NASA student launch in Huntsville, AL. This process included concept genesis and review, technical adjustments to design, prototyping and testing, and final fabrication. I worked to draw up components in CAD then 3D print, CNC mill, or order parts. I also aided in constructing the final design with these parts as well as designing the deployment mechanism in the rocket bulkhead. Additionally, I worked to write sections of the Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, and Flight Readiness Review, all of which were reviewed and critiqued by NASA personnel.</p>

          <h3 class="project-header">IoT Cloud Connectivity Project</h3>
          <p> As a final project for my Internet of Things class in Berlin, Germany, a partner and I constructed a noise-level monitoring system designed to keep a room below comfortable noise levels (85 dB), alerting the user if the threshold is breached. Through this, I learned how to develop a basic control system in Python as well as communicate between micro-controllers over the web using the MQTT cloud infrastructure.

          <h3 class="project-header">Solar Panel Mounting System</h3>
          <p>Capstone project for AME 21268 (Design Tools II). I worked on a four-person team to design and prototype a solar panel mounting system. We managed project throughout the entire product cycle, through idea generation, idea selection, critical review, prototyping, and final presentation. Additionally, we had to provide frequent project updates and design review presentations as well as create a full CAD design, spec sheets, BOM, order parts, and assemble in the workshop.</p>

          <h3 class="project-header">Audio Cancellation Application</h3>
          <p>Final project for Spring EG 10102 class. Collaborated with 5-person team to implement a GUI-based MATLAB application to remove unwanted hum frequencies from audio samples. Additionally, learned the skills needed to design a custom application for a specific need as well as how to keep a deadline and provide update presentations.
